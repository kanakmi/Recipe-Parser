# Recipe Parser

Recipe Parser is a common recipe website with not so common functionalities. <br>

The features it includes are:
- Searching for recipes by Name (yeah I know, it's a common one ðŸ˜‘)
- A recipe recommendation system based on the ingredients (AI ðŸ§  Yeah, now we are talking)
- Searching for recipes by Food's Image (told ya ðŸ˜„! it's different)

## How I buit it

- I built the image classfier using CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) during a previous hackathon [(learn more)](https://github.com/kanakmi/Recipe-Parser/blob/main/Food_Classifier/README.md).
- I collected recipes of the dished covered in image classfier using beautiful soup and saved them in a database.
- I built the recipe recommendation system using Cosine Similarity.
- I built the UI of the application using Streamlit.
